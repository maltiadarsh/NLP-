# NLp
# Approach of Solution
##  Setup and Initialization:
•	Imported necessary libraries for data handling (pandas), web scraping (requests and Beautiful Soup), text processing (nltk and TextBlob), and file handling (os and docx).
•	Ensured NLTK’s data packages for tokenization and stopwords were downloaded.
##  Data Loading:
•	Loaded the input Excel file containing URLs into a Pandas DataFrame.
## Directories and Files:
•	Created a directory to store the extracted article texts and specified an output file for storing the text analysis.
##  Text Extraction Function:
•	Defined a function extract_text(url) to fetch the webpage content, parse it, and extract the article’s title and body text. This function assumes the article’s main content is contained within <p> tags.
##  Processing URLs:
•	Iterated over each row in the DataFrame, extracted the URL and URL ID, and used the extraction function to get the article’s title and text.
•	Saved each article’s text in a file named after its URL ID and also added the text to a Word document for later review.
##  Sentiment and Text Analysis:
•	Defined a get_sentiment(text) function to compute the sentiment polarity using TextBlob.
•	Created an analyze_text(text) function to perform various text analyses:
o	Tokenized text into sentences and words.
o	Removed stopwords and computed metrics like average sentence length, percentage of complex words, FOG index, word count, and syllable count.
o	Calculated sentiment and subjectivity scores.
##  Analysis and Output:
•	Performed the analysis on each extracted text file and stored the results.
•	Saved the results in both a Word document and an Excel file, including metrics like positive and negative scores, FOG index, and average word length.
##  Completion:
•	Printed a confirmation message once all tasks were completed

## To run the main.py file to generate output

## To run your main.py file and generate the output, follow these steps:

##	Save our Script:
	Make sure your Python script (the code we have shared) is saved in a main.py file. 
•	Prepare Your Environment:
	Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org if needed.
	Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:
   pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests nltk textblob python-docx
	Ensure you have an input Excel file named Input.xlsx in the same directory as your script. This file should contain a column named URL_ID and a column named URL with the web addresses to scrape.
•	Run the Script:
	Open a terminal or command prompt.
	Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example:
                            cd path/to/your/directory
	Execute the script by running:
 python web_scraping_analysis.py
## 	Check Outputs:
	Text Files: The script will create a directory named extracted_articles with text files for each article, named after their URL IDs.
	Word Document: A Word document named Text Analysis.docx will be created in the same directory as your script. This document will contain the extracted articles.
	Excel File: An Excel file named Output Data.xlsx will be generated, containing the analysis results of the articles.
•	Review Results:
	Open the extracted_articles directory to find the text files.
	Open Text Analysis.docx to review the extracted text in a formatted document.
	Open Output Data.xlsx with Excel or another spreadsheet program to view the analysis results.
# Required Dependencies
## The list of all the required dependencies:
1.	pandas: For handling data in DataFrames and working with Excel files.
2.	beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
3.	requests: For sending HTTP requests to fetch web page content.
4.	nltk: For natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and stopwords.
5.	docx: For creating and manipulating Word documents.
6.	textblob: For sentiment analysis and text processing.
To install these dependencies, you can use the following commands:
